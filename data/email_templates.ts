Hi [Client's Name],
If you own an investment property, a Tax Depreciation Schedule can help you maximize your tax deductions by outlining the wear and tear on your property that can be claimed as depreciation. Essentially, it’s a detailed report that allows you to claim deductions on the declining value of your property’s structure and assets—helping you reduce your taxable income and increase your cash flow.
To make this process easy, we’ve partnered with Duo Tax, one of Australia’s leading quantity surveying firms, to provide our clients with a discounted rate on their depreciation schedules.

To help you navigate Xero more easily, here’s a quick video tutorial on how to access, download, and e-sign documents:
Watch here - https://youtu.be/TDTrMI-N9fU

Having Trouble Logging In?
If you share a laptop or computer, you might occasionally run into login issues. This is due to Xero’s enhanced security measures, designed to protect your account from cyber threats.

If clicking the 'Review Documents' button in the email doesn’t work, try this instead:
1) Go to Xero Portal - https://portal.xero.com/
2) Log in using the same email address where the documents were sent
3) This is the same as clicking 'Review Documents' in your email—once logged in, your documents should appear.

Still Having Issues?
Because Xero runs in your web browser, sometimes a quick cache refresh or clearing your browser cache can resolve login problems. 

If you’re still having trouble, feel free to call us at 1300 829 825—we’re happy to assist!

Best regards,

Dear [Client's Name],
I hope you're doing well.
I wanted to send a friendly reminder regarding our policy on modifications or extensions to the originally agreed Scope of Services.
The initial engagement, as outlined in our proposal, was carefully tailored to meet your specific tax, accounting, and compliance needs. This Scope of Services defines all agreed-upon services, deliverables, and associated costs to ensure transparency and alignment.
Making Changes to the Scope
To maintain efficiency and clarity, any proposed alterations or extensions to the scope will need to be:
✅ Discussed and mutually agreed upon before work begins.
✅ Formalized in a "Service Extension Agreement," which will outline:
•	The proposed changes
•	Any impact on project timelines
•	Any additional costs (if applicable)
We will only proceed with additional work once we have received your approval of the revised scope.
Next Steps
We value open communication and believe that clear expectations lead to the best outcomes. If you have any questions or require further clarification about our policy on scope modifications, please don’t hesitate to reach out.
We appreciate your understanding and look forward to continuing to support you.
Best regards,

  subject: "Understanding Your ASIC Annual Review Process and Fees",
  body: `
Dear [Client's Name],
Thank you for reaching out. I appreciate the opportunity to clarify the ASIC annual review process and associated fees to ensure your company's compliance and avoid any unnecessary penalties.
Annual Review Fees
Each year, ASIC requires companies to pay an annual review fee to maintain their registration. For a proprietary company, the current fee is $321. 
Our office facilitates this process by sending all necessary documents to you via FuseSign. 
Late Payment Fees
Timely payment is crucial to avoid additional charges. If the annual review fee is not paid by the due date, ASIC imposes late fees as follows:
•	Payment up to one month late: $96
•	Payment more than one month late: $401
To assist you in meeting these deadlines, our system is programmed to send reminders 3-4 weeks prior to the due date. This proactive approach aims to help you avoid any late payment penalties.
Our Invoice
In addition to the ASIC fees, you will receive an invoice from our office. This charge covers the administrative time spent managing the annual review notice from ASIC on your behalf.
If you have any further questions or require assistance with this process, please don't hesitate to contact me. I'm here to help ensure your company's compliance and smooth operation.
Best regards,

  id: "TaxReturns7",
  subject: "Understanding Your Division 293 Tax Liability",
  body: `
Dear [Client],

What Is Division 293 Tax?
An extra 15% tax on concessional super contributions once your income + contributions exceed $250,000.

Who Pays It?
Anyone whose adjusted income (taxable income, fringe benefits, investment losses, and concessional contributions) is over $250,000.

How It’s Calculated

If adding your super contributions pushes you over $250,000, only the excess amount is taxed at the extra 15%.
If you’re already over $250,000 (including contributions), the entire concessional amount is taxed at 30% (15% normal + 15% additional).
Paying It

The ATO issues an assessment; you can pay directly or release funds from super.
Impact
This effectively raises the tax on some super contributions from 15% to 30%. Despite this, super remains a tax-effective strategy. If you have questions or want to review your super plan, let me know.

Best regards,
